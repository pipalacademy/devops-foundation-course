# Lab Setup

A virtual machine in the cloud is created for every participant of the training. The details of the node will be shared during the first day of the training. Each of you will receive a card with the details of your hostname. It would look something like the following:

<img src="../images/alpha.png" style="height: 200px;"/>


The hostnames will be something like `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, etc.

If your hostname is `alpha`, you can login to your server using the following command:


```
$ ssh alpha.k8x.in
Password:
```

That'll prompt you for a password. The password to login to the node will be shared during the beginning of the training.
